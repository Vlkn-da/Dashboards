1. What demographic groups have the highest churn rates?

2. How does having an unlimited data plan affect the likelihood of churn?

3. What are the primary reasons customers are leaving?

4. Does the churn rate decrease with increased account length?

5. Are there geographic patterns to churn that could indicate regional market challenges or opportunities for targeted marketing campaigns?

6. How do the churn rates correlate with other customer metrics such as usage patterns or service level received?
